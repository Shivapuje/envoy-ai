# AI Assistant Instructions

## Project Guidelines

This document contains instructions for AI assistants working on the Envoy AI project.

## Commit Message Guidelines

When creating commit messages:
- **DO NOT** reference AI assistants (e.g., "Claude", "GPT", "AI", etc.) in commit messages
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages that focus on **what** changed, not **who** made the change
- Follow conventional commit format when appropriate: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, etc.

**Good examples:**
```
Add agent logging API and flow visualization page
Update documentation with new features
Fix email modal attachment display
Refactor AI engine to support multiple models
```

**Bad examples:**
```
Claude added agent logging feature
AI-generated documentation updates
GPT helped fix the bug
```

## Documentation Guidelines

When writing or updating documentation:
- **DO NOT** reference AI assistants as authors or contributors
- All documentation should be attributed to the actual project author: **Vinayak Shivapuje**
- Focus on technical content, not the process of creation
- Maintain professional, technical tone

## Code Comments

- Write clear, helpful comments that explain **why**, not **what**
- Avoid meta-references to AI assistance in code comments
- Focus on technical rationale and design decisions

## General Principles

1. **Attribution**: All work is attributed to the human developer (Vinayak Shivapuje)
2. **Professionalism**: Maintain professional standards in all documentation and code
3. **Clarity**: Focus on clear, technical communication
4. **Consistency**: Follow existing project patterns and conventions

*These guidelines ensure the project maintains professional standards and proper attribution.*
